Organization admin, Folder or project admin, Storage admin, or System health specialist. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles.^]

.Before you begin

You need the following:

* A Connector using version 3.9.43 or later. You must have the Org admin role to install a Connector.
+
The Connector can reside in the cloud or on-premises. It just needs a network connection to the StorageGRID system.

+
. If you want to use a different certificate than the one displayed, you must first configure it on your StorageGRID system.
.. In your on-premises StorageGRID system, follow the instructions: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/admin/configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.html#add-a-custom-management-interface-certificate[Installing a management interface certificate on StorageGRID^].

.. After configuring the certificate in the StorageGRID system, select *Cancel* on the _Approve certificate_ page in BlueXP.

.. On the _StorageGRID Cluster Details_ page, select *Add*.

. Optionally, select *Copy Certificate* to copy the details of the certificate. You can use the certificate details to perform additional validation if desired.

. Do one of the following: 
.. Select *Approve Certificate* to use the certificate. 
+
A success message appears. All communication between the StorageGRID server and the BlueXP connector will be secured by verifying the approved certificate.

.. Select *Cancel* to end the discovery process without verifying the certificate. 
+
For example, you can select *Cancel* if you receive an error message notifying you that the StorageGRID management certificate needs to be updated. 
+
To update a certificate, go to your StorageGRID system, update the certificate, and then restart the discovery process from BlueXP.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the StorageGRID system and adds it as a working environment on the Canvas.
